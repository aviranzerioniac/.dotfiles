## My Personal dots

This is a backup of my dots. As much as possible, the configuration will always remain barebones.

## Current State

I have finally made a jump to qtile and seems like I'll be staying here for some time.
I do have a barebones xfce install, which might need to be cleaned in the future.
I was using either [Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org) or
[Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) for quite some time.
The emacs config has finally been worked on enough that it
seems to work good enough for me, at least most of the times.
Further
changes will be focused on configuring my emacs configuration to the best
possible config.
