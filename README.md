## My Personal dots

This mostly has configurations for many Window Managers from when
I was still searching for one. New additions are primarily
keybindings and optimizations here and there. I'd like to believe that the way it is now,
I don't have make drastic changes but keep on polishing things.

## Current State

I keep XFCE for the sole purpose of not making people who want to use my laptop
for a few minutes scared of whatever I am running.
Qtile is the one, which takes most of my time as I feel quite at home with it.
Emacs for anything I write, and python, or haskell, or C/C++.
For Java, I use IntelliJ, we use it for some projects, and I started loving it
after a few changes here and there.

You can just use the code in terminal

`bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://git.io/vQgMr)"`
