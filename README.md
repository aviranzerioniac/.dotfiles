## My Personal dots

This is a backup of my dots. As much as possible, the configuration will always remain barebones.

## Current State

I have finally made a jump to qtile and seems like I'll be staying here for some time.
I do have a barebones xfce install, which might need to be cleaned in the future.
I was using either ![Spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org) or ![Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) for quite some time. Further changes will be focused on configuring my emacs configuration to the best possible config.
