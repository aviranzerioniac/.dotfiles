It might come as a surprise, but only after a few days on August, I came back to esmeralda. Although I could have done many things and learned many new things from Senecca, I had to get back. The thought of an imminent war on esmeralda has grown even more in my mind. 
" 0 270 (fontified t)) #("Think of an animal, even the most primitive one, it sustains itself on food. Some form of nutrition is elementary for the survival of an organism. We weren't any different. But we explored, we experienced, we learned and finally we evolved. From a species of scavangers and scrapers, we became the hunters. Then we gathered, we formed groups, and then communities, societies, civilizations. We learned that alone, we could survive. But as a group, we thrived. Our prime motive, to search for food, went to the backs of our mind. Not everyone can have the same, we are still not there, but we are damn close. 

To believe that we can live without a form of sustenance is plain dumb. But at the same time, to believe anyone of us, can live without hope is dumber. A hope for the betterment of oneself, of one's life, of one's family, is not selfish, on contrary, its healthy. Noone can live a selfless life. Not me, not you. We have to have faith that we can have better things in life for ourselves, before we can even believe that we can make other's life better. A frog living in the bottom of the well, can't imagine the vastness of the bright blue sky. Unless you know what you can achieve for yourself, have hope of achieving something for yourself, you won't be able to contribute to the betterment of all. You can't motivate yourself to get out of the bed in the morning unless you hope that the day will bring better things than what the night brought.

Some news can just absorb all the goodness from you. Maybe you had plans, maybe you were hoping for things to get better. But some things are just out of your control, and despite knowing that, all you can do is feel disappointed. Maybe, not much will help you then, but hope definitely will.

After being down for a few weeks, I was back, feeling hopeful that with enough help, we could perhaps, be able to survive this ordeal. Not as a group but as a civilization of diverse groups. 


I had been ruminating for days on what was the best thing I could do. I tried thinking of solutions, I tried all the things I could, but after exhausting all my mental muscles, I was drawing a blank. Like a writer not knowing how to proceed, I was getting hopeless. I wasn't paying much attention, right at that moment, my cup of coffee just spilled on the carpet. Without a hitch, my vaccum cleaner started its work. Maybe, we are just thinking this all wrong. Maybe we are pinning our hopes on the wrong organisms. Maybe we are just dumber than the things we created. Maybe the point of having hope is not to be the one to do everything by yourself, hope is rather contagiuos afterall.

It was long before the technology was even there, that the concept of terraforming was in our minds. Long before we could even dream of turning it into a reality. Long before the actual science. We have had trial runs for years. But none can be termed successful. I have been trying to create an artificial greenhouse in a sattelite just to prove it is doable. But things don't always work as we want them to. Most of our inventions are a product of tireless experimentations and improvements on a single idea through generations. Perhaps, this is going to be the same. Perhaps, I will not get to see it being fulfilled, but perhaps starting a road for the future to tread on is what we should always be focusing on. If we had understood that before a few centuries, perhaps, this wouldn't have happened. But we are most of the times, who we are, sometimes unapologetically us, but inherently human, nevertheless.

If only my project could work, we could just up and leave this planet, which has been our home for milleniums. We as a species have already exploited and harassed the planet for too long. Maybe, someday this planet will go back to its previous state. Maybe it will be good enough for sustainable human occupancy again at some point. But now, because of our own irresponsiblity, we are losing the only home, we ever had. No matter what kind of a person you are, that should make you sad.

The concept of terrestrial Sattelites isn't a new one. We have had probes go further than the borders of our solar system. We don't have light speed travel, but given enough time, even turtles can travel hundreds of kilometres. The idea is to make a sattelite sustainable and habitable in itself. Not for a group of people or a few, but for a part of the population. They need to be able to live, grow and sustain themselves as if they are in an environment, not too foreign than earth's. Of course, we can't emulate everything. But we humans, are known to be capable of being comfortable in any place and call it home. It has to sustain generations and generations to come. And then maybe someday, we will develop our technology to a point to be able to make a new planet, in some remote part of the universe our home. Maybe, someday, we will have a new home. Maybe we will die off long before we reach that point. Anything can happen, but the only priority is to give ourselves enough time. Maybe even with all our differences, and even in a turtle's pace, we will innovate, and live and not die off. All I am doing is trying to outline the road. If we walk in it, if we succeed, that is not for me to answer.

-- on SOTs (Systems of Terra) \"an Eternity of a Lifetime\"


Months of travel and I came to August for this? We already know this. I always thought Prof. Autrach to be someone who wrote great things. The articles in the internet are some of the most beautifully written ones. They describe us not only as a bunch of hooligans but also as a group of wise men. But this page has not much information about anything. 

Dumbfoundedly, I looked at Senecca. He was smiling, perhaps laughing at the stupidity of two generations, to have made the same journey painstakingly, just to read three paragraphs of fucking nothing. \"Is this all?\" I asked him.

\"Have you read \"On Hope\"?\" He never could answer to anything, always liked to answer with questions.

\"No. What is it?\" I have a question for you too friend. You see, I'm learnig your ways.

\"It is one of those articles you can probably find in the archives. It is about how we have to have hope. Nobody knows who worte it, but it was always thought to be written by Autrach as well.\" He answered.

\"Motherf****r! So, after coming here, I have to go back, go to the fu****g archives? Just to understand whatever this is all about? This Autrach guy seems like a troll. Trolling us from his grave, laughing at our stupidity for milleniums.

\"Actually, I do have the article. You can read it just here if you want.\" Senecca said. He seemed to be able to hear my internal screamings as well.

\"Where is it?\" I asked.

\"I will send someone to get it for you. Do you want it now?\"

\"No, I want it to be send to esmeralda. I will probably get to read it after four or five months, probably after forgetting all about this manuscript. That would be for the best.\" I thought internally.

\"Yes.\" I still had to say. I came for the clues about dad. And if this could give me some of those, I had to read it. 

\"Okay. It will be sent to you.\" He said.

\"Thank you.\" I had fulfilled my motive for coming here. I didn't know what to do now. He seemed to know my predicament.

\"Have you ever seen how terraforming is done? Do you want to?\" He asked.

I was always fascinated by the concept. I had seen it happen. But it is one of those \"Open Book\" secrets. Everyone knows what it is, but only a select few are allowed to know the actual process. We have strict regulations when it comes to terraforming. It can be done on every single planet, but the selection has to adhere to the rules. And very few can fulfill all. Most of the times, it is about the compromises. We don't want to disturb the evolution of its aboriginal species, neither do we want to waste resources on a rock, which will never be livable. We are too poor to fail too often. And even after one fulfills all the requirements, we can't say for certain how our microbes will react to the environment. Over the years, it has gone from trying to make a planet more \"Earth like\" to just trying to make the planet \"hospitable\". In comparison to a few hundred or even a few decades ago, we know so much about it. But the technology is still nascent. It is biological programming. Some code works in some environments perfectly, but change the environment, the code acts like a monkey. Modify something seemingly insignificant, the code stops functioning at all. The same is true for terraforming. 

\"I would love to.\" I said.

\"Come lets go to the Valley.\" He said calling for his transporter at the same time. Even in earth we had transporters. Altough primitive, they did the same thing as these, took you from A to B. But these are all-terrain beasts. They can move in speeds, in diverse terrains, make decisions and make choices to support those decisions. These are moving pods, just smaller. Best of all, you just need to give a destination, and all the choices from A to B are made, without intervention. Self-driving on steroids. But I'd be disappointed in our species, if we couldn't even make something like this. Most of the technology is developed either of need or convenience. And most of the times convenience takes the wheel.

In a few minutes, we were in front of a brown stretch of land. Endless emptiness. I thought terraforming meant plants, animals, at least something moving. This just seems like a dead plot. Only difference, this dead plot is under the secure artificial ozone, not outside of it. 

\"Is this it?\" Feeling a little disappointed, I asked.

\"Yes. This is it. Dead land being turned into living with help of microbes. This is the alpha phase for terraforming.\" Senecca explained.

\"How many phases are even there?\" I curiously asked. I might not get the trade secrets, but I might learn enough to impress some ladies in esmeralda.

\"Many.\" With frustation he replied. \"The principle is quite simple you know. You start by making it habitable for the microbes. These are genetically tailored for a particular environment. That lays the foundation for plants, bacteria and algae. Once oxygen is naturally produced, we can call it semi-done. And start adapting to the environment and its constraints. Sounds simple, doesn't it?\"

\"Yeah, I guess.\" I knew there were many small things we still failed in. He could see me agreeing unwillingly.

\"The problem isn't in theory. It has always been in its implementation. Even genetically engineered, many of the microbes can't sustain themselves in inhospitable environments. We can live with our suits nearly everywhere. Not for long, but we can sustain our lives for some duration with technology. But microbes can't do that themselves and we have not been able to make them. We can make enclosures to sustain life. Prof. Autrach pioneered the technology. If not our species would be extinct for centuries. But terraforming, we all believe it can be done, but doing it, that is still a problem.\" I could hear his words as well as the helplessness in his voice.

\"Do you think it can be done?\" I asked.

\"I have read and performed many experiments. All I can say is that even now, we rely heavily on research based on earth's restraints. We are too far from it, and don't plan on going back. But we carry it with us. We can't seem to shake off the fact that even without earth, life can thrive. Once we internalize this and once a generation goes forward with this idea in mind, we will be successful.\" I thought him to be realist, but he seems to be an optimist at heart. 

\"How long will it take?\" I was intruiged.

\"A few generations, perhaps a few centuries. I hope to be able to see it happen.\" He was smiling as if he was imagining the day when it happened, and him being there.

We talked and walked around the biome for some time. He was explaining everything to me like I was starting my own terraforming project. I liked listening to the ideas and concepts, but it seemed too much for someone as lazy as me to even imagine of doing.

He invited me to dinner. I wanted to go and read \"Oh Hope\" first. He said I could come after finishing it and discuss the article with him. I readily agreed. I had already taken Capsom for the day, but a little eating would not be detrimental. I was rather looking forward to it.

When I reached my pod, I saw that I had an E-Mail from an anonymous source titled \"On Hope\". I found it a little strange but whatever it was, I didn't dwell on it for too long. I started reading the article.

I have never been so fascinated with a single man than senecca, the overseer of August. 

I am in system EAX44B since a month. The system is similar to our origin system. Eight planets surroundíng a red dwarf of a star. Gravity is 0.9 of Estelle. No troubles with adapting. The star can give the planet light and warmth. Days are darker. Half of August is frozen. In the other half, people seem to get by. It is by no way, estelle. But I could get used to this. The planet is mostly barren. Less than 10% of it was successfully terraformed. Its been centuries but we can't still get the technology right. Hey, it nevertheless works right?

After being in the planet for a month, I finally got my appointment. I met Senecca the same day that I got to see the part of the manuscript for \"the Eternity of a Lifetime\". I can't decide which was more interesting though, Senecca or the manuscript. The manuscript was a page long. Perhaps a scribble by the Autrach, an interesting one, but not much to read. Senecca on the other hand, still more mysterious to me.

We had a lengthy conversation, which has me still befuddled. Are there immortals among humans? Are there at least humans, who have lived for far too long? I don't know.

We talked about the gods of the old. We talked about the great migration. We talked about the past as well as the future of us as a species. Senecca talks about many events like he was there to witness those. I can't still be certain, which parts were make do and which he actually witnessed. But to think that there is a faint possibility, this self-proclaimed middle-aged man might know more about us and everything than even the venerated elders, is not only scary but also highly comforting at the same time.

I'm still processing the information I got from him. Perhaps, someday much will make sense to me, or perhaps it never will. But there is one thing that got me hopeful about the future. I learned that ours is not the singular SoT. SoTs are the terrestrial Systems like the one Estelle is a part of. SoTs were made in the onset of the 25. century. These are artificially terraformed sattelites, which can sustain life for a millenium at the minimum. The technology looks archaic by modern standards. But for the 25., these were state of the art. They were made and launched in batches during the 25. from the origin system. Estelle is part of the prime. It is part of the first ones launched and uses the most primitive of the technologies. But even if Estelle still works great, I want to go to the other SoTs. I want to learn from them, I want to share ideas with them. I want to know how separation of centuries has changed us as humans. I want to know, if we can improve on Estelle or if we can migrate to the other SoTs. Estelle is reaching the end of her time. Faster than the supposed time frame, but what can you expect from the archaic system? She has been the mother to generations of us. But it is time, we need to search for a new system, where perhaps, even my grandson can imagine a future.

Senecca said something that has stuck in my mind all day. There seems to have been factions during the old days. In the last days of the origin system, we seem to have had many different factions, which followed different idealogies. The faction which took estelle seems to be one of the preservation factions, Belassung. The principle behind this faction seems to have been the preservation of human culture as it was during the time period. I can't say for certain if it was the best option, but it has worked for so long, I can't say it was outright wrong. I am a product of the action those representatives of Belassung took in the 25. century. If it had failed anywhere in the past, I wouldn't be tackling these questions. I am thankful they stood by their opinion and I am thankful I exist as I do now. Although I wouldn't have supported them, if I was alive at that time, I still am thankful they did it. Sometimes, future is just similar set of people with similar idealogies asking the similar set of questions. Senecca seems to be of the other group. He thinks we should have either forced ourselves to sustain and try to live on the planet, which is the origin of the entire humanity. Or we should have taken a singular escape route, which would have still defined humanity as the collection of separate ideas as it always was than separating humanity into batches of different idealogies. But which way is right, the one we took, or the one we didn't? Who can say for certain? There is no one alive in these metal lumps who can answer the question for us. Only endless speculations.

-- The unpublished pages of the Diary of P. Seamus


I always assumed overseers lived a lavish lifestyle. Sitting in this house which isn't accurately a house, I can't say I am at the right place. But at the same time, I can't say for certain I am at the wrong one. There isn't much to see. A few books, who does still have them? Haven't we outgrown the technology? There is a place, in the left side of this room, which seems like a place to cook, kitchen as they called it. Don't people here have Capsom capsules? Take one, and your required calories for a day are fulfilled. Our technology has already outgrown some of the restrictions induced upon us by our meat bag of a body. But here, it seems everything still lives. Is this how people of August live? What a backward planet. Use one of the greatest technology known to man, terraform an entire planet. And live like you are in what? The 20. century? Absolute foolish bunch of people.

\"I hope you like my humble abode, Dr. Seamus.\" The guy, who looks a few years older than me, with eyes filled with geniune curiosity asked. In my mind I was just formulating a seemingly official form of speech to thank the overseer for the opportunity. Well, no matter how he lives or what he does in his private time, he is an overseer choosen by the hundreds of thousands living in this planet with weird looking sky. He might be a little quirky with many ideas to waste time, like by reading or cooking, but he is an important man, somehow respected by all. I thought I needed to actually use a mighty way to greet while meeting him for the first time. But the statement just confused me. Do I lie or do I be honest, and offend him in the process? I sheepishly said \"It looks fine. But it is weird seeing many of the things here, anywhere except in the museums or photos.\"

He just laughed and said: \"Your dad just lied as an answer. You seem more honest than him.\"

\"I just thought you guys met only once. What was he like?\" I had many more questions in my mind. But that was all I could say. I even forgot any form of greeting, not that he seemed to mind.

\"He was a good guy. The things he did for humanity will always be remembered. He took a near dead species and gave them a new life. You should be proud of him.\"

I didn't know how to answer. I am proud of him, but all I got as a father was the concept, he was never there. Even now, we don't know where he is. He just went and did his thing, forgetting anyone who might have been inheriting the consequences of his actions. He seemed to be able to read my thoughts, but didn't pester me. \"How can I be of help, Dr. Seamus?\" He asked, diverting the conversation elsewhere.

\"I'd like to read the page of \"the Eternity of a Lifetime\" that you have. I have been trying to trace the steps of my dad. The last artice published by him was nearly five years ago. At first, I thought he was working on something, and just forgot to do anything else like he always does. But now, I think something might have happened to him. We haven't been able to contact him through any means for years.\" 

\"Of course. I'd be happy to be of any help. Would you like to see it now, or if you want, we can do it after dinner.\" He just accepted, which surprised me. Dad had to wait for a month, didn't he? I'd have been delighted to look at it at the moment, but the concept of dinner intruiged me.

\"Dinner?\" I asked.

\"Yes, I like cooking. Let me prepare something for the both of us. It won't take much.\" He said, as he walked through the room to the corner which seemed like his kitchen.

\"Okay. What do I do in the mean time?\" I didn't know how this worked. I just asked.

\"You can just sit here and provide me some company. Tell me about yourself.\" He said, going through the container, where a lot of fresh plants were.

\"Okay. I was born in the year 3101 in estelle. I have been working for the Society for the preservation of Human Culture since I completed my doctorate in 3132. I have been living in esmeralda since the last migration, six years ago.\" I just went ahead and gave some info about myself.

Looking quite surprised, he asked \"You work for the Belassung?\"

I didn't know what he meant for a second. Belassung was what the Society was originally called. \"Yes?\" I said.

\"Your father would have found your job choice pretty amusing.\" He laughed like he had just heard the greatest joke of the multiverse.

\"Why?\" I asked.

\"He didn't like their archaic idealogies. He thought humanity as a whole needed to strengthen themselves through a joint effort, if we are to ever survive the hurdles we'll face as a species. He didn't like that there were groups who valued themselves and their own concepts more than our survival as a species.\" He would have gone and said some more, if I hadn't asked him anything.

\"Archaic idealogies?\" I asked.

\"What do you think is the core directive of the Belassung?\" He asked.

\"The preservation of our culture is the preservation of our species.\" I gave him the one sentence, each one of us knew by heart.

\"Whose culture do you think it actually means?\" The reply I got back was just as I expected. This is a frequently asked question. Some might even say, I and most of us at the Society learn to read the individual and answer this question accordingly. I myself am an expert at answering this.

\"It is ours. We humanity share a culture, no matter where we live. And if we can keep sharing the culture with everyone who we come in contact with, we will grow and we will survive as a species.\" I smugly answered.

\"What does that even mean?\" The next question was also pretty standard. I was as prepared as I was for my doctorate thesis. 

\"It means that we, The Society, work to preserve our culture. We define culture as what we have been doing for generations and we try to preserve our way of life, in turn preserving humanity.\" See, I told you I was an expert.

\"This rethoric would have worked if we were all living in estelle, but now, which culture would you be preserving in esmarelda?\" This question was a new one. And I understood it came with hidden dimensions.

\"Of course, as a species, we'd try to accomodate everyone and preserve our culture.\" I replied without even thinking.

\"I know how the Belassung works. It has always tried to preserve itself. The culture it values has always been the one you had in estelle, and even now you should know, you are trying to preserve what you had there. And there is going to be a huge conflict in esmarelda, one which will be the spark for a war, which you don't seem to comprehend at this moment.\" Senecca flatly stated it as if a war was predestined. 

\"Belassung has never been a tolerent faction, but its weakness was never obvious as it had its own playground. But now as it has to share its playground with someone else, it will be the beginning of its own doom. Your dad understood this, hence his strong dislike\". He continued. \"You seem to have never took this factor into consideration, but once you do, you will know it to be the truth. Come lets eat. Hopefully you will enjoy it.\"

I looked at the lump he said food. It was all green and some meat. The quantity was bigger than my ration of Capsoms I bought to last me for a whole month. Is this what the older generations ate to sustain themselves? I was curious. We took our seat and started eating. It tasted weird, but it stimulated my tongue. It looked like nothing I'd have ever thought edible or even want to eat. I was thinking of taking a few bites and say I was done, but once I started eating it, I couldn't stop myself.

Senecca looked at me eating like I was a little kid and he laughed. \"Not all of the old ways were useless. I never could let go of some. I love to cook, it stimulates me to be creative. We don't have things we used to have at earth. But we do have things which have unique flavours. I have a small garden where I plant things I'd probably enjoy. Everyday I take something from there and cook for myself and anyone who is there. Some enjoy what I do, some call me names for still holding on to the old ways. But I could never let go of things even as a little boy.\"

I listen to him talking. Like an old man, who has seen many things. But how can he? He is perhaps as old as my dad. Seems like this is a play for him. What a charlatan!! It was all I had on my mind but I wanted to play his game. \"What do you mean by old ways?\" I asked.

\"We used to cook and eat what we prepared. It was a process, every single person did. Different cultures prepared different things, but everyone ate. Untill Capsom was invented, this is how we sustained ourselves. We used to read, we learned through reading. Learning was a process. We lived for a 80 years at most. We had nature to keep us company. So many things are lost forever either because of our stupidity or intelligence as a species.\" He sounded as if he was lamenting our failures and stating our achievements as a species together.

In the age of capsom capsules, memory modules and age regression drugs, I found it baffling that he seemed to still think of the old ways as a greater representation of us than the now. I had to ask : \"Do you think we as of now are a better representation of humanity or the old centuries did it better, on earth?\"

Senecca suddenly seemed to have aged by a thousand years, he looked at me, and then looked at the dark red sky. He seemed to have thought of something, which I don't quite understand, then he asked me \"What do you think?\"

I pondered on the question for a minute, still munching on the meat he cooked. What was it? Eating an animal seems somehow cruel to me, but at the same time, I can't seem to stop. But which animal can we eat and which we can't? In estelle, we never have had to think of this. Just take the capsom capsule once a day, and be done with it. But here, it got me guessing. Rather than replying him, I asked \"Which animal is it?\"

\"Oh, just one of the rabbits I rear.\" He said. 

\"You keep animals to eat?\" What a weird concept.

He looked as if he was a teacher and I had just asked a truly stupid question. \"You do know this was done for generations and milleniums in the origin planet?\"

\"No, we didn't have such records in estelle. I always thought we had older versions of capsom capsules, maybe we had to take a few per day, but we always had them. Isn't that the case?\" I replied with uncertainity.

\"Belassung loves to keep records of the things it actually wants its people to know. Everything else is redundant.\" Senecca sounded a little angry as he said it.

\"You know what makes humanity dangerous? We act like pests. We twist facts to fit our theories like its second nature. For milleniums, we had groups of people living in a single rock, sharing although unwittingly all the troubles and resources that we had. But once that dynamic changed, the cohesion of humans as a cultutre disappeared. Like sides of a coin, the old humanity and the new share the origin. But we are so different, that one will never see the other as a part of itself.\"

\"What do you mean?\" I was intruiged as well as scared of what he was implying.

\"Belassung has worked for generations to adhere and conserve a human culture, it thought was the true humane one. A culture of sophisticated and highly intelligent beings. But what about other species, which used to coexist with us? In Earth, we first killed off all the creatures we could eat, or tamed some of them to eat in the future. Than we degraded the planet itself, killing some which couldn't cope with us acting as petulant childs in our playground. Kids cry and we know someone is trying to harm them, and we protect them. But those species died off, before we could even understand their cries. Then there was a scarcity of food, so we started killing biomes. Predators or the apex ones, who can actually fend off pests which are big and coordinated enough to essentially do anything, and do it repetedly. They died off as well.\" He sounded sad.

\"But we had animals in Estelle. We even migrated a large portion of them to esmeralda with us. What do you mean by we don't preserve them?\" I had to ask.

\"I am sure you know of evolution and how it takes generations?\" He asked. \"Of course, I know.\" What did he think I was? A 5 year old?

\"Just like we did, other species also could have evolved into more complex creatures, given enough time. The possibility was always there, although no certainity. We plundered everything, robbing them of the chance to do it in their own pace fulfilling their biological needs and evolving to fulfill those which they couldn't. Then in the name of preservation, we went and kept them in captivation. And then during the migration, we took them with us, still captives. Now some animals have been captives for so long, and the concept of wild, is already too remote. Every alive species is already domesticated. How do you think they will evolve? Don't you think in trying to preserve them, we have made them take a fork in their own evolution, turning them into something they'd never have been if not for us? Didn't we elect ourselves as the guardians of the living and have been preserving them as we see fit? Does having an artificial sattelite give us power over other species? And if we exercise these powers over other species so naturally, what makes you think, we won't do so to our own? Can you say for certain that two groups living separated for nearly a millenium with no form of communication will have the same idealogies? Does that mean one is true and the other is not? Does that mean one will have to go?\" It seemed like he was asking me as well as himself. And I couldn't answer them. 

\"When you take a long enough time scale into consideration, most of the things seem so insignificant. When you look back, you see a planet not capable of sustaining its inhabitants and those inhabitants doing their best to preserve as many things as possible and getting out of the planet, for survival. When I look back, I see struggles of kins, kinds, of species, of many species to survive. I see us using our powers to not only preserve or destroy, but worst, to contain. You know that your father bought back the news of existence of two other systems: Esmeralda and Venus. Why do you think Belassung made the choice to migrate to Esmeralda and not Venus?\" I had always had this question in mind.

\"Because the resources needed to migrate to Venus were too much for Estelle and us to handle?\" I asked.

\"Thats what they say. What do you think?\" He didn't answer me, rather asked another question.

\"I believe we did it because it was closer. Also esmarelda is more advanced one, it was made with consideration for a large population, and even after the migration, we have enough resources to fully sustain us for generations to come.\" I told him what i knew to be the truth.

\"Estelle was the first one, it had people from every phases and socio-economic backgrounds in it. In some ways, it was the Noah's arc. Its original directive was to search and find habitable planets, as well as preserve an ounce of true humanity. It also took many species, near extinction, to make sure they don't die off. The beginnings are always noble. It was just a group of intellects and researchers, who had power in estelle. They were supposed to preserve. Over the years, the directive changed hands, definition, words, but still remained. But now, the same words and the same directives are going to start a war. First one we've had since leaving earth. Esmeralda was choosen not because it can suatain, but because it has resources to spare. Venus is a slum. It always has been. It has no rules. You can't win against villians who have been villains for generations. But Esmeralda started off as an escape pod for the rich. They have lived in comfort for so long, they will go down without a big battle. That is the reason Belassung chose Esmeralda.\" He said as if this was a fact.

It was getting late, and I was getting tired by his smugness. \"Will it be okay, if we continued this tomorrow? I would like to go and rest.\" I said.

\"Yes. I will be sending someone to get you tomorrow. You can take your time with the manuscript as well. Good night, Dr.\"

\"Good night, Overseer\" I got out of there and looked around.

August was choosen to be terraformed as an example of how far the technology has come. It was the last and the most successful of all. But we could only get 10% of it habitable. And the process of getting the other 90 to be hospitable, not habitable, will take milleniums at best. The area livable can sustain 150000 of its inhabitants, but when it comes to 7.5 million from Estelle, it was a little too small. We were already nearing the extinction of more than half of the population, if we had to abandon estelle for august. It was a stroke of fortune we found and could communicate with esmeralda. And it is fate, we still get to live. And that was the work of my dad, Pete Semus. I always thought we made first contact with esmeralda and made plans to migrate there before we even knew of venus. But now, I am not so sure.

Within a few minutes, I reached my pod for today. In such a colony, there are no houses. Buildings can't be moved efficiently, hence, they made easily movable ships into houses. The initial terraforming can take upto 3/4 centuries. Only after that will there be houses. But for me, who never had a house till I was 25, I don't honestly miss them. A pod already has everything I might need. Within minutes of reaching my pod, I was asleep.
